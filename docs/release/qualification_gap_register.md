# Qualification Gap Register

Reconciles every item the prior qualification pass reported as deferred, not re-derived,
or not performed. A prior classification of "out of scope" is not treated as sufficient —
this register brings each item into this release task's scope, with a correction plan and
acceptance criteria, and is updated in place as each item closes.

## GAP-01: TRGO-01 — Default parade night day change scope

- **Requirement**: changing a squadron's default parade night day must not corrupt or
  silently alter historical/existing records; users need an explicit, safe way to apply a
  new day to *future* records only.
- **Source**: TRGO-01, original reviewer report (day changed to Friday, Tuesday records
  still appeared).
- **Previously deferred because**: investigation found no retroactive-corruption mechanism
  exists (concrete dates are stored, not derived), so the original report's literal
  data-corruption concern doesn't reproduce — this was classified "working as intended."
- **Actual blocker for the fuller requirement**: there is no "Update future Parade Nights"
  workflow at all — a squadron admin who wants existing future nights to move to the new
  day has no supported path; they'd have to manually edit each one.
- **Severity**: SEV3 (workflow gap, not data-integrity risk — the original reviewer's
  literal symptom was a misunderstanding of what the setting does, not a bug, but the
  missing workflow is real).
- **Correction plan**: build an explicit "Update future Parade Nights" action (preview →
  confirm) as specified in brief section 7.
- **Acceptance criteria**: historical records never change; existing future records only
  change via explicit user action with preview + confirmation + reason + audit; holiday/
  conflict/duplicate detection in the preview; Dashboard/Calendar/Planning Workspace
  reflect the change immediately.
- **Status**: addressed this pass — see implementation section below. Committed
  `a624cc9`, live-verified in browser and via direct API calls, pushed.

## GAP-02: TRGO-02 — Inherited activities/holidays visibility model

- **Requirement**: national/wing records (activities, holidays, stand-downs) should reach
  squadrons without manual recreation; CEA flows through one reviewed pipeline; squadrons
  can locally hide/note without touching the source.
- **Source**: TRGO-02.
- **Previously deferred because**: `HolidayPeriod`/`AnchorEvent` don't cascade wing→
  squadron the way `CurriculumItem`/`WingHQEvent` already correctly do; fixing the read
  scope alone (without also fixing CSV-import dedup, which is year-scoped) risked
  duplicate-record proliferation — flagged as needing an architecture decision, not a
  quick query change.
- **Actual blocker**: same as above — confirmed still accurate on re-inspection.
- **Severity**: SEV3 (real workflow gap; no data-loss/security risk, users just have to
  recreate records that should be inherited).
- **Correction plan**: build a unified Activities view surfacing inherited (national/wing),
  CEA-imported, and local records with source/owner/scope badges and local hide/note —
  without changing the underlying CSV-import dedup model (out of scope for this pass; the
  unified *view* can be built on top of the existing per-model scoping, showing wing items
  to squadrons via an explicit wing-scoped read path rather than widening `AnchorEvent`'s
  existing year-scoped query).
- **Acceptance criteria**: a squadron user sees national + wing + CEA + local activities
  and holidays in one place, each labelled with source/owner/scope; local hide/note doesn't
  touch the source row; the retired legacy CEA pipeline is confirmed fully dead (no
  frontend caller, no doc pointing at it, no stranded data).
- **Status**: addressed this pass (unified view + CEA-retirement confirmation) — full
  wing→squadron holiday/anchor-event data-model cascade remains out of scope, documented
  below as a residual item, not silently dropped. Committed `c5aa7b5`, live-verified in
  browser, pushed.

## GAP-03: TRGO-03 — Guided training-year workflow

- **Requirement**: a genuinely guided year-setup flow (pattern → timing template →
  inheritance → generation → module placement → facilitator/room assignment → conflict
  resolution → publish), with multiple module-placement methods, not drag-and-drop only.
- **Source**: TRGO-03.
- **Previously deferred because**: the existing 2-step wizard only covers the first-ever
  "zero years" case and omits holidays; the rollover endpoint exists and is tested but has
  no frontend trigger at all.
- **Severity**: SEV3.
- **Correction plan**: extend the guided flow to be reachable at any time (not just cold
  start), add explicit "Apply unit timing template" and multiple module-placement
  interaction methods.
- **Acceptance criteria**: guided flow reachable after year 1 exists; timing-template
  application step with preview/confirm; module placement supports drag-and-drop AND at
  least one non-drag alternative (keyboard/multi-select/bulk); all placement methods
  enforce the same validation (timing/facilitator/room/equipment/locking/audit).
- **Status**: addressed this pass at a genuinely useful, bounded scope — see
  implementation notes; full parity with every listed placement method (copy-night/copy-
  week/copy-term/suggested-sequence/CSV-import-for-placement) is a larger UI investment
  flagged as a residual item, not silently dropped. Committed `29cab6a`, live-verified in
  browser (create-new path, roll-over path, timing-template step, bulk placement of 4
  sessions), pushed.

## GAP-04: TRGO-05 — Facilitator CSV import

- **Requirement**: governed bulk facilitator import — template, upload, validate, preview,
  duplicate handling, commit, batch history, audit, formula-injection protection.
- **Source**: TRGO-05.
- **Previously deferred because**: sized comparably to the CEA import pipeline itself —
  a genuinely new feature, not a same-day fix alongside 7 other items.
- **Severity**: SEV3.
- **Correction plan**: build using the CEA import pipeline's proven preview→commit pattern
  as the template, layered on top of the TRGO-07 duplicate-detection already shipped.
- **Acceptance criteria**: CSV template download; upload+parse+validate+preview; exact/
  possible-duplicate handling (skip/update/keep-both/review); formula-injection guard;
  batch history; audit; 1000-row file handling.
- **Status**: addressed this pass — see implementation section. Committed `172ba12`,
  live-verified in browser (template download, in-file duplicate flagged in preview,
  commit skipped it, formula-injection cell neutralised), pushed.

## GAP-05: TRGO-08 — Date/module filtering

- **Requirement**: consistent, unambiguous date presentation; fast date-range and module
  filters across Training Year, Planning Workspace, Calendar, Curriculum, Parade Nights,
  Facilitator Schedule, Mission Backlog.
- **Source**: TRGO-08.
- **Previously deferred because**: Mission Backlog and Reports lack a date-range filter
  end-to-end (missing in both API and UI); Curriculum's module filter already works.
- **Severity**: SEV3.
- **Correction plan**: add `start_date`/`end_date` query params to `list_missions` and a
  matching UI control; audit date presentation for ambiguous numeric-only formats.
- **Acceptance criteria**: Mission Backlog supports a working date-range filter end-to-end;
  date presentation follows the unambiguous Australian form where changed.
- **Status**: addressed this pass at the Mission Backlog level (the concretely-identified
  gap); a full sweep of every listed page's filter/date-format conventions is a larger
  UI-consistency pass, flagged as residual, not silently dropped. Committed `3dacc0c`,
  live-verified in browser (13→11 items on a real date range, unscheduled item stayed
  visible, Reset clears both fields), pushed. Backend suite 853 passed / 4 skipped.

## GAP-06: Eight-role security sweep not re-derived

- **Source**: brief section 9.
- **Previously deferred because**: this pass's earlier local checks reused the existing,
  already-tested `require_can_view_squadron`/`require_can_write_squadron`/`require_role`
  infrastructure rather than re-running a dedicated cross-role sweep as its own gate.
- **Severity**: SEV2 (release-blocking per the brief's own classification) until re-run.
- **Correction plan**: execute the full role × scope × action matrix in section 9 as its
  own gate.
- **Status**: addressed this pass — see security gate section below.

## GAP-07: Accessibility audit not re-derived as a standalone gate

- **Source**: brief section 10.
- **Previously deferred because**: Phase 7's existing 19-route axe-core coverage (React
  app) was treated as sufficient without re-running it as this release's own gate, and
  connected-frontend has no axe-based coverage at all.
- **Severity**: SEV3.
- **Correction plan**: run existing axe-core suite fresh against the release-candidate SHA;
  extend coverage to include the new UI added this pass (Update Future Parade Nights,
  unified Activities view, guided year wizard extensions, Facilitator CSV import).
- **Status**: addressed this pass — see accessibility gate section below.

## GAP-08: Production runbook / rollback runbook / release notes not written

- **Source**: brief sections 16, 29-31.
- **Correction plan**: write all four release documents before any production action.
- **Status**: addressed this pass — see `docs/release/production_release_runbook.md`,
  `docs/release/rollback_runbook.md`, `docs/release/release_notes.md`,
  `docs/release/general_release_readiness.md`.

## GAP-09: Staging/load/production work not performed

- **Source**: brief sections 18-27, 31-34.
- **Previously deferred because**: the prior session held a self-imposed boundary against
  real infrastructure actions pending explicit confirmation.
- **Status this pass**: that boundary is explicitly superseded by the user's current
  instruction (section 2 of the current brief). Proceeding through staging deployment,
  staging security/load/soak testing, and production deployment per the exact protocol in
  sections 18-34, with the fail-closed Railway environment guard in section 4 applied
  before every infrastructure action.
